quote: "_Now the world will need someone like you_"
lyrics:

    
    A firefly in the dark
    
    told me to follow the, 
    
    follow the light

    Go set the world alight
    
    now we rise, we rise... up
    
    Like ashes in the night


    Some people say that we are going too far
    
    They say we should live with our feet on the ground
    
    And we said to them that we are going to the sun 
    
    When we start to fall then it's time to fly

    
    SEE THE ANGELS
    
    HOVERING ABOVE, AND NOW
    
    TRY TO FIX THE SONG
    
    WITH THE STARS WE KNOW

    ALL THE ANGELS
    
    LOOKING UPSIDE DOWN BECAUSE
    
    NOW THE WORLD WILL NEED
    
    SOMEONE LIKE YOU

    
    The sun is up now,
    
    the music is playing
    
    Can't you see that all the clouds are gone?
    
    Don't let it pull you down
    
    Throw those things
    
    miles away, miles away


    Some people say that we are going too far
    
    They say we should live with our feet on the ground
    
    And we said to them that we are going to the sun 
    
    When we start to fall then it's time to fly

    
    SEE THE ANGELS
    
    HOVERING ABOVE, AND NOW
    
    TRY TO FIX THE SONG
    
    WITH THE STARS WE KNOW

    ALL THE ANGELS
    
    LOOKING UPSIDE DOWN BECAUSE
    
    NOW THE WORLD WILL NEED
    
    SOMEONE LIKE YOU


    Now the world will need some love

    and someone like you now

    Fix the song, fly above the world

    Don't let go again


    SEE THE ANGELS
    
    HOVERING ABOVE, AND NOW
    
    TRY TO FIX THE SONG
    
    WITH THE STARS WE KNOW

    ALL THE ANGELS
    
    LOOKING UPSIDE DOWN BECAUSE
    
    NOW THE WORLD WILL NEED
    
    SOMEONE LIKE YOU
