quote: "_I know a Street made of gold_"
lyrics:

    I've broken my mind, am I right?

    Can't see it, but I know I won't.
    
    I can't move it back where it belong.
    
    But I had to be strong, I had to be strong, I had to be strong


    I wish one day we'll return home

    I know a Street made of gold

    I watch in the fire and below, fire and below

    I wish one day we'll return home

    I know a Street made of gold

    I watch in the fire and below, fire and below, fire and below, fire and below


    I'VE BROKEN MY MIND, AM I RIGHT?

    CAN'T SEE IT BUT I KNOW I WONT 

    CAN'T MOVE IT BACK WHERE IT BELONG

    BUT I HAD TO BE STRONG, I HAD TO BE STRONG

    I WISH ONE DAY WE'LL RETURN HOME

    I KNOW A STREET MADE OF GOLD

    I WATCH IN THE FIRE AND BELOW

    I WISH ONE DAY WE'LL RETURN HOME

    I KNOW A STREET MADE OF GOLD

    I WATCH IN THE FIRE AND BELOW, FIRE AND BELOW


    I wish one day we'll return home

    I know a Street made of gold

    I watch in the fire and below, fire and below,

    I wish one day we'll return home

    I know a Street made of gold

    I watch in the fire and below, fire and below,

    fire and below, fire and below, fire and below, fire and below
