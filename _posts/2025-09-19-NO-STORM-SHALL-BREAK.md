quote: "_No storm shall break what He promised to be sealed_"
lyrics:

    He leaves the shore,
    
    The sail is raised.
    
    His eyes on more
    
    Than passing beside you.
    
    He walks with grace,
    
    Not just alone
    
    But led by faith
    
    To build a home.

    
    She stands, his star,
    
    With hands in a prayer.
    
    Her dress in white
    
    The truth in the Higher
    
    A vow begun
    
    With will and desire
    
    Two hearts made one
    
    In His loving arms.

    
    NO STORM SHALL BREAK
    
    WHAT HE PROMISED TO BE SEALED 
    
    THOUGH WINDS MAY SHAKE,
    
    THEIR LOVE IS REAL.
    
    THEY WALK THROUGH THE FIRE,
    
    THROUGH JOY AND THE PAIN 
    
    WITH GRACE ENTIRE,
    
    THEIR STEPS WILL REMAIN.

    
    Their house is stone,
    
    Not sand or a drift.
    
    Where He is known,
    
    Their souls will lift.
    
    They plant the cross
    
    In soil made for true 
    
    And count no loss
    
    For all is gain

    
    NO STORM SHALL BREAK
    
    WHAT HE PROMISED TO BE SEALED 
    
    THOUGH WINDS MAY SHAKE,
    
    THEIR LOVE IS REAL.
    
    THEY WALK THROUGH THE FIRE,
    
    THROUGH JOY AND THE PAIN 
    
    WITH GRACE ENTIRE,
    
    THEIR STEPS WILL REMAIN.
    
    
    So go, dear friends,
    
    With heart made wide.
    
    Let love never end,
    
    Let it grow and guide.
    
    The path is long,
    
    But you shall see, that with Christ youâ€™re stronger than I,
    
    Stronger than I, Stronger than I, stronger than you, 
    
    stronger than you, 

    
    NO STORM SHALL BREAK
    
    WHAT HE PROMISED TO BE SEALED 
    
    THOUGH WINDS MAY SHAKE,
    
    THEIR LOVE IS REAL.
    
    THEY WALK THROUGH THE FIRE,
    
    THROUGH JOY AND THE PAIN 
    
    WITH GRACE ENTIRE,
    
    THEIR STEPS WILL REMAIN.
